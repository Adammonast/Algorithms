# Algorithms

How to formally think about and solve algorithmic problems as part of the Algorithms module. Some classic algorithmic paradigms will also be introduced.

How to analyze the complexity of algorithms. Students will practice classifying algorithms using Big O notation, and learn how to compare different algorithms against each other using these runtime classifications.

## Iterative Sorting

- Objectives:
Define what runtime complexity is, differentiate between various classifications and categorize the performance of an algorithm using Big O notation
Describe the differences between Linear and Binary Searching algorithms
Classify the performance, and implement code to conduct classic iterative sorting algorithms

## Recursive Sorting

- Objectives:
Identify when a problem is amenable to a recursive solution and use recursion to solve it
Trace and accurately identify the output of a recursive function call
Write a recursive solution to a problem
Distinguish when to use, classify the performance, and implement code to conduct classic recursive sorting algorithms

## A First-Pass Solution

- Objectives:
Effectively ask for help by giving the expected vs. experienced behavior, explaining what specific actions they've taken so far, and providing all relevant information and code
Interpret a problem, specification, or diagram and construct a plan for implementing a solution in code
Implement a first-pass solution after selecting from a na√Øve, brute-force, or greedy approach

## Writing Better Solutions

- Objectives:
Evaluate a first-pass solution and reflect on its validity to decide if the solution needs revision
Apply techniques such as memoization or heuristics to improve an existing first-pass solution
